[Day 7] Assignment: Steganography
    - Turn in on Gradescope (https://make.sc/bew2.3-gradescope)
    - Lesson Plan: https://tech-at-du.github.io/ACS-3230-Web-Security/#/Lessons/Steganography

Deliverables:
    1. All TODOs in this file.
    2. Decoded sample image with secret text revealed
    3. Your own image encoded with hidden secret text!
